# **1️⃣ Remove Element (LeetCode 27)**  

#### **Understanding the Problem**  
I need to go through `nums` and remove all occurrences of `val` **in-place**, returning the new length. I assume this means shifting elements without creating a new array.  

#### **First Thought Process & Attempt**  
I tried modifying my **LeetCode `26. twoSum`** solution, thinking of using an index variable `j` to track the valid elements. However, something felt off. I assigned `nums[val] = nums[i]`, but... wait, that doesn’t make sense—`val` is a value, not an index!  

#### **What’s Wrong?**  
- How does `j` actually help here? Does it just follow `i`?  
- If I assign `j = i`, wouldn’t the code break when iterating?  
- Oh, I see—`j` isn’t tracking `i`, it’s tracking where to place non-`val` elements!  
- The key is **only incrementing `j` when an element is kept**, not every iteration.  

#### **Final Realization & Solution**  
I need to **overwrite elements in-place**, keeping track of non-`val` elements using `j`. This way, I only modify `nums` **when necessary**, instead of blindly shifting.

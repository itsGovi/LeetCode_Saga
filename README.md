# LeetCode Saga

Welcome to **LeetCode Saga**, a personal journey to sharpen my algorithmic thinking, problem-solving skills, and Python expertise through solving LeetCode problems. This repository serves as a journal to document my learning process, thought patterns, and the logic behind my solutions.

## Why This Repository?
1. **Track Progress**: Keep a detailed log of the problems I solve, the concepts I learn, and how my problem-solving approach evolves.
2. **Understand My Thinking**: Explain why I chose specific lines of code or logic, reflecting on alternative approaches and trade-offs.
3. **Learn Through Mistakes**: Highlight the errors I encountered, how I debugged them, and what I learned from them.
4. **Encourage Iterative Learning**: Continuously refine solutions to improve time and space complexity while maintaining clarity.

## Structure
Each problem I solve is documented in its own folder, containing:

1. **`problem.md`**: A markdown file with:
   - Problem description (from LeetCode).
   - Key concepts and patterns involved.
   - Thought process and step-by-step breakdown.
   - Edge cases considered.
   - Reflections on mistakes and lessons learned.

2. **`solution.py`**: The Python implementation of my solution.
   - Includes comments explaining the logic behind each part of the code.

3. **`test_cases.md`**: Test cases I designed or used to validate the solution.

## Problem Solving Workflow
1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - Read the problem carefully and identify constraints and edge cases.
   - Decompose the problem into smaller parts.

2. **Plan the Solution**:
   - Start with a brute-force approach to understand the basics.
   - Think about patterns or optimizations to improve the approach.

3. **Write and Test**:
   - Implement the solution in Python, iterating and debugging as needed.
   - Test the code against edge cases and large inputs.

4. **Reflect and Refactor**:
   - Document what worked, what didnâ€™t, and why.
   - Explore alternative solutions and discuss trade-offs in complexity.

## Topics Covered
This repository will cover problems from various categories, including:
- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Dynamic Programming
- Trees and Graphs
- Backtracking
- Greedy Algorithms
- Hashing
- Two Pointers
- Sorting and Searching

## Goals
- Solve at least 100 LeetCode problems across easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels.
- Develop an intuition for algorithms and data structures.
- Write clean, efficient, and well-documented code.
- Enhance critical thinking and adaptability for real-world problem-solving.

## How to Use This Repository
This repository is designed to help beginners and intermediates learn from my process:
- **For learners**: Use this as a reference to understand how to break down and approach problems step-by-step.
- **For self-improvement**: Compare different approaches and learn from the trade-offs discussed.

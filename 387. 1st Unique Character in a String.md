### **Understanding the Problem**

I began by reminding myself of the objective: find the index of the first unique character in a string. I needed to consider two main phases:

1. **Counting Character Frequencies:**  
   I had to traverse the string once to record how many times each character appears. The idea was to use a dictionary (or hash map) where the key is the character and the value is its count.

2. **Identifying the First Unique Character:**  
   After building the frequency map, I needed to loop through the string in its original order to find the first character whose frequency is exactly one. If no such character exists, I would return `-1`.

### **Phase 1: Building the Frequency Dictionary**

I started by iterating over the string. For each character, I updated the frequency count in the dictionary. I quickly learned that using the `.get()` method simplifies this step:

```python
character_dict[ch] = character_dict.get(ch, 0) + 1
```

This one-liner ensured that if the character wasn't already in the dictionary, it would default to 0 before adding 1.

### **Phase 2: Finding the First Unique Character**

With the frequency dictionary built, I then looped over the string using `enumerate(s)` to get both the index and the character. For each character, I checked if its count in the dictionary was exactly 1:

```python
for index, ch in enumerate(s):
    if character_dict[ch] == 1:
        return index
```

If I completed the loop without finding a unique character, I returned `-1`.

### **Optimizing with Built-In Functions (Option A)**

I later learned about Python's `collections.Counter`, which is implemented in C and offers a faster way to build the frequency dictionary. This allowed me to replace my manual counting with:

```python
from collections import Counter
count = Counter(s)
```

Then, the rest of the solution remained essentially the same. This approach was clean and efficient for any character set.

### **Optimizing for Memory (Option B)**

Knowing that the problem might sometimes guarantee only lowercase English letters, I explored an alternative approach using a fixed-size array. Here’s what I did:

1. **Initialize a List of 26 Zeros:**

   ```python
   counts = [0] * 26
   ```

2. **Update the Count for Each Character:**

   For every character `ch` in the string, I calculated its index with `ord(ch) - ord('a')` and updated the count:

   ```python
   for ch in s:
       counts[ord(ch) - ord('a')] += 1
   ```

3. **Find the First Unique Character:**

   I iterated through the string with `enumerate(s)` and returned the index of the first character with a count of 1:

   ```python
   for i, ch in enumerate(s):
       if counts[ord(ch) - ord('a')] == 1:
           return i
   return -1
   ```

This approach is optimal in terms of space since it uses O(1) extra space (always 26 integers) and is very efficient when the input is limited to lowercase letters.

### **Reflection**

Working through this problem taught me several important lessons:
- **Separation of Concerns:** I learned to clearly separate the frequency counting phase from the phase where I check for the unique character.
- **Use of Built-Ins:** Leveraging Python’s `Counter` can simplify and speed up my solution.
- **Memory Optimizations:** When the character set is limited, a fixed-size array is an excellent alternative to a dictionary.
- **Order Preservation:** Iterating through the string in its original order is crucial to finding the *first* unique character.

I now feel confident in both approaches and understand the trade-offs between them. This exercise deepened my understanding of frequency counting and optimization techniques in Python.

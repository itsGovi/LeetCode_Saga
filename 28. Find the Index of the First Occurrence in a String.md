Below is my complete journal entry for Problem 28: **Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String**. This is the story of how I worked through the problem—from my first ideas to the final optimized solution.

---
I began by breaking down the problem in my own words. I reminded myself that I need to find the first index in the **haystack** (the long string) where the **needle** (the smaller string) appears. I thought of it like searching for a needle in a haystack.

I considered the following:
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - What if the needle is an empty string?  
  - What if the needle does not occur in the haystack at all?
- **Brute-Force Method:**  
  - I could iterate through the haystack one character at a time.
  - For each candidate index, I would extract the substring of the same length as the needle and compare it to the needle.
  
I outlined a simple pseudocode in plain English:
1. If the needle is empty, return `0`.
2. Loop over every valid starting index in the haystack (from `0` to `len(haystack) - len(needle)`).
3. At each index, compare the substring `haystack[i:i+len(needle)]` with the needle.
4. If they match, return the index.
5. If no match is found by the end of the loop, return `-1`.

This initial brainstorming gave me a solid starting point to implement a brute-force solution.

In my next session, I refined my approach further. The AI confirmed that my method was on the right track and added more details:
- **Iteration:**  
  I learned that I should only loop from `0` to `len(haystack) - len(needle) + 1` so that I never try to extract a substring beyond the end of the haystack.
- **Character Comparison:**  
  First, I should compare the character at `haystack[i]` with `needle[0]` as a quick filter.
- **Substring Comparison:**  
  If the first characters match, then I extract the substring using slicing (i.e., `haystack[i:i+len(needle)]`) and compare it directly with the needle.
- **Edge Cases:**  
  I must remember to return `0` if the needle is empty, and `-1` if no match is found after scanning the haystack.

This conversation solidified the importance of careful boundary checking and efficient iteration.

---
As I started coding, I encountered some issues. The AI walked me through my mistakes:
- **Incorrect Range:**  
  I had initially written something like:
  ```python
  for i in (len(haystack) - len(needle)):
  ```
  which doesn’t iterate over the intended indices. The correct way is:
  ```python
  for i in range(len(haystack) - len(needle) + 1):
  ```
- **Wrong Comparison:**  
  I mistakenly tried to compare `haystack[i] == needle[i]`, but that doesn’t work because I need to compare the candidate substring (starting at index `i`) with the needle. Instead, I learned to use slicing:
  ```python
  possible_needle = haystack[i:i+len(needle)]
  if possible_needle == needle:
      return i
  ```
- **Edge Case Handling:**  
  I also had to ensure that if the needle wasn’t found, I return `-1`.

This step-by-step debugging helped me understand the nuances of Python’s slicing and the importance of checking the correct range.

---
In another round of review, the AI helped me pinpoint a few more errors:
- **Empty Needle Check:**  
  I had erroneously written:
  ```python
  if needle == 0:
      return 0
  ```
  which compares a string to a number. I corrected it to:
  ```python
  if needle == "":
      return 0
  ```
- **Indexing Consistency:**  
  I learned that for each candidate position in the haystack, I should always compare `haystack[i]` with `needle[0]` (not `needle[i]`), because the needle must be compared from the start.
- **Correct Substring Extraction:**  
  I reinforced the idea that the candidate substring must be extracted as:
  ```python
  haystack[i:i+len(needle)]
  ```
  so that it exactly matches the length of the needle.

With these fixes, my brute-force solution was now correct and handling all the edge cases properly.

---
Finally, I looked into optimizing my solution. While my brute-force method worked, I realized it was creating new substrings on each iteration, which could be inefficient in terms of space if the haystack is very large. The AI suggested:
- **Avoid Extra Substrings:**  
  Instead of slicing out a substring each time, I could compare characters one-by-one directly using a nested loop.
- **Character-by-Character Comparison:**  
  For each index `i`, I can loop over the needle’s indices (`j`) and compare `haystack[i+j]` with `needle[j]`.
- **Using `all()` with a Generator Expression:**  
  An alternative was to use:
  ```python
  if all(haystack[i+j] == needle[j] for j in range(len(needle))):
      return i
  ```
  This way, I compare characters on the fly without allocating extra string objects.

I weighed the trade-offs: while slicing is simple and readable, doing an in-place comparison saves memory. Given the typical problem constraints, both methods are acceptable, but I appreciated the insight into optimizing for lower memory usage.

### **Conclusion**

Through these conversations, I transitioned from a basic brute-force approach to a more optimized solution. Each chat helped me refine my method—starting with understanding the problem and brainstorming ideas, then debugging and correcting errors, and finally optimizing for efficiency.

This journey not only improved my solution for Problem 28 but also deepened my understanding of string manipulation, indexing, and Python’s slicing mechanics. I now feel confident in both writing a correct solution and thinking about performance optimizations.

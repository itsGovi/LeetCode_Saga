### Step 1: **Understanding the structure of Pascal's Triangle**
- I know that each row depends on the previous one. So, for each new row, I need to use the values from the previous row to calculate the new row.
- The number of rows in Pascal's Triangle is given by `numRows`, which is my input.
  
I’ll start by considering how to generate the rows. Each row starts and ends with a `1`. The values in between are the sum of the two values directly above them.

---

### Step 2: **Think about how to keep track of the rows.**
- The first row (index 0) is always `[1]`.
- To create each subsequent row, I’ll need to refer to the previous row.

Now, what data structure should I use to store all the rows?

---

### Step 3: **How would I loop through rows?**
- How would I loop from `1` to `numRows`? I’ll need to keep track of how many rows I’ve already generated.
  
---

### Step 4: **Generating the middle elements.**
- For a row beyond the first, the elements in the middle come from the sum of two adjacent numbers in the previous row.
  
Can I think of how to get the adjacent elements from the previous row?

---

### Next steps:
- I’ll think about **how to start each row** and **how to compute the middle values**. Once I have a plan for this, I’ll refine it and work towards the final solution.

---
**_THE NEXT STEPS...._**
I’m **very close** to getting this right! My loop structure is mostly correct, but there are a few issues I need to fix. Let’s break down where I went wrong, why it happened, and how to correct it.

---

### **Issues in My Code**
1️⃣ **`previous_row` is not defined before using it**  
   - I referred to `previous_row` inside the loop without first assigning it.  
   - I need to explicitly set `previous_row = triangle[row_index - 1]` before I use it.

2️⃣ **Unnecessary nested loop**  
   - I had an extra loop that wasn’t needed.  
   - I only need **one loop** to iterate through `previous_row` and compute adjacent sums.

3️⃣ **Row starts with `[1]` but doesn’t end with `[1]`**  
   - Pascal’s Triangle rows always start and end with `1`, but I only handled the start.  
   - I need to append a `1` at the end after computing the middle values.

---

### **Fixing My Approach**  
#### **Step 1: Define the Triangle Storage**  
- Start with an empty list `triangle` to store all rows.  

#### **Step 2: Iterate Through `numRows`**  
- For each row index `row_index`, initialize the row with `[1]`.  
- If `row_index > 0`, fetch the `previous_row` from `triangle[row_index - 1]`.  

#### **Step 3: Compute Middle Values**  
- Loop through `previous_row` to compute adjacent sums:  
  - `new_value = previous_row[j] + previous_row[j + 1]`  
  - Append `new_value` to `row`.  

#### **Step 4: Append the Final `1` and Store the Row**  
- Add the last `1` at the end.  
- Append the completed row to `triangle`.  

---

### **Key Fix: Adjacent Sums in Pascal’s Triangle**
Each new row’s middle values come from adding adjacent values in the previous row:  

```
previous_row = [1, 3, 3, 1]
next_row = [1, (1+3), (3+3), (3+1), 1]
           [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
```
  
In code, this translates to:
```python
for j in range(len(previous_row) - 1):
    new_value = previous_row[j] + previous_row[j + 1]
    row.append(new_value)
```
**Why `len(previous_row) - 1`?**  
- Stops before the last index to prevent out-of-bounds errors.  
- Ensures I only sum adjacent values.  

---

### **Final Fix Plan**
Now, I need to update my function by:  
✅ Defining `previous_row` **before** using it.  
✅ Removing the unnecessary loop.  
✅ Appending the last `1` at the end of each row.  
✅ Properly summing adjacent elements.  

Next, I’ll fill in the missing parts of my code and run it against test cases to verify correctness. 🚀
---
I works I still need to wrap my head around the syntax and structuring of the code.
Was definitely fun (kind of irritating when got to the middle) solving it.

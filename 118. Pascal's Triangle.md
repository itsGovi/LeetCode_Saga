### Step 1: **Understanding the structure of Pascal's Triangle**
- I know that each row depends on the previous one. So, for each new row, I need to use the values from the previous row to calculate the new row.
- The number of rows in Pascal's Triangle is given by `numRows`, which is my input.
  
I’ll start by considering how to generate the rows. Each row starts and ends with a `1`. The values in between are the sum of the two values directly above them.

### Step 2: **Think about how to keep track of the rows.**
- The first row (index 0) is always `[1]`.
- To create each subsequent row, I’ll need to refer to the previous row.

Now, what data structure should I use to store all the rows?

### Step 3: **How would I loop through rows?**
- How would I loop from `1` to `numRows`? I’ll need to keep track of how many rows I’ve already generated.

### Step 4: **Generating the middle elements.**
- For a row beyond the first, the elements in the middle come from the sum of two adjacent numbers in the previous row.
  
Can I think of how to get the adjacent elements from the previous row?

### Next steps:
- I’ll think about **how to start each row** and **how to compute the middle values**. Once I have a plan for this, I’ll refine it and work towards the final solution.
